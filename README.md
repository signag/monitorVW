# monitorVW

The program periodically reads car data from Volkswagen WeConnect and stores these as measurements in an InfluxDB database.

For WeConnect, see: <https://www.volkswagen-nutzfahrzeuge.de/de/digitale-dienste-und-apps/we-connect.html>

As interface to WeConnect Web Services, I use <https://github.com/trocotronic/weconnect>

In order to use the program you need
- A registration at WeConnect
- An Influx DB V2.4 or later running on the same or another machine
- A Grafana instance vor visualization

InfluxDB (<https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/>) is a time series database which can be used as cloud version or local installation on various platforms.

For visualization with Grafana, see <https://grafana.com/>

## Getting started

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                       |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.   | Install **monitorVW** (```[sudo] pip install monitorVW```) on a Linux system (e.g. Raspberry Pi)                                             |
| 2.   | Install and configure an InfluxDB V2.4 (<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.4/install/>)                                                |
| 3.   | In InfluxDB, create a new bucket for status data (<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.4/organizations/buckets/create-bucket/>)          |
| 4.   | In InfluxDB, create a new bucket for trip data this should be different from status data because of longer retention period                  |
| 5.   | In InfluxDB, create an API Token with write access to the buckets (<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.4/security/tokens/create-token/>)|
| 6.   | Create and stage configuration file for **monitorVW** (see [Configuration](#configuration))                                                  |
| 7.   | Do a test run (see [Usage](#usage))                                                                                                          |
| 8.   | Set up **monitorVW** service (see [Serviceconfiguration](#serviceconfiguration))                                                             |

## Usage

```shell
usage: monitorVW.py [-h] [-t] [-s] [-l] [-L] [-F] [-f FILE] [-v] [-c CONFIG]

    This program periodically reads data from VW WeConnect
    and stores these as measurements in an InfluxDB database.

    If not otherwises specified on the command line, a configuration file
       monitorVW.json
    will be searched sequentially under ./tests/data, $HOME/.config or /etc.

    This configuration file specifies credentials for WeConnect access,
    the car data to read, the connection to the InfluxDB and other runtime parameters.


options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t, --test            Test run - single cycle - no wait
  -s, --service         Run as service - special logging
  -l, --log             Shallow (module) logging
  -L, --Log             Deep logging
  -F, --Full            Full logging
  -p, --logfile         path to log file
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Logging configuration from specified JSON dictionary file
  -v, --verbose         Verbose - log INFO level
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Path to config file to be used
```

## Configuration

Configuration for **monitorVW** needs to be provided in a specific configuration file.
By default, a configuration file "monitorVW.json" is searched under ```$HOME/.config``` or under ```/etc```.

For testing in a development environment, primarily the location ```../tests/data``` is searched for a configuration file.

Alternatively, the path to the configuration file can be specified on the command line.

## InfluxDB Data Schema
**monitorVW** uses the following schema when storing measurements in the database:

|Data Element              |Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| _time                    | carStatus: timestamp when data is written to InfluxDB           |
|                          | trip     : timestamp when trip was ended                        |
| _measuerement            | "carStatus", "trip_shortTerm", "trip_longTerm", "trip_cyclic"   |
| **tags**                 |                                                                 |

| - fuelConsumed           | Fuel consumed (l) for trip - only trip measurements             |
| - electricPowerConsumed  | Electric power consumed (kWh) for trip - only trip measurements |

## Serviceconfiguration

To continuously log car data, **monitorVW** should be run as service.

A service configuration file template can be found under
```./data``` in the installation folder.

| Step | Action                                                                                             |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.   | Adjust the service configuration file, if required, especially check python path and user          |
| 2.   | Stage configuration file: ```sudo cp monitorVW.service /etc/systemd/system ```                     |
| 3.   | Start service: ```sudo systemctl start monitorVW.service ```                                       |
| 4.   | Check log: ```sudo journalctl -e ``` should show that **monitorVW** has successfully started       |
| 5.   | In case of errors adjust service configuration file and restart service                            |
| 6.   | To enable your service on every reboot: ```sudo systemctl enable monitorVW.service```              |
